# 📊 Daily Data Science & Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Daily Data Science & Machine Learning** repository 🚀  
This repository documents my **consistent, hands-on learning** in Machine Learning, focusing on both theory and real-world implementation.

I believe in *learning by doing*—building models, experimenting with datasets, and improving performance through evaluation and optimization.
